# Einstein Logic Puzzle Solution
Date: 2025-08-02

## Problem Summary
This is Einstein's famous logic puzzle asking "Who owns the fish?" given 15 constraints about 5 houses with different colors, nationalities, drinks, cigarettes, and pets.

## Reasoning Process

### Step 1: Establish Basic Framework
From the constraints, I first identified the definite positions:
- Constraint 9: Norwegian lives in house 1
- Constraint 14: Norwegian lives next to blue house → Blue house is house 2  
- Constraint 8: Middle house (house 3) owner drinks milk
- Constraint 4: Green house is immediately left of white house
- Constraint 5: Green house owner drinks coffee

### Step 2: Determine House Colors
Since house 3 owner drinks milk but green house owner drinks coffee, green house cannot be house 3.
With house 2 being blue, the green-white pair must be houses 4-5.
This leaves houses 1 and 3 as yellow and red.

From constraint 1: British person lives in red house
From constraint 7: Yellow house owner smokes Dunhill

### Step 3: Logical Deduction Chain
Since Norwegian is in house 1, and we need British in red house, house 1 must be yellow (Norwegian + Dunhill) and house 3 must be red (British).

From constraint 11: Horse owner lives next to Dunhill smoker
Since Norwegian in house 1 smokes Dunhill, horse owner must be in house 2.

### Step 4: Nationality and Drink Distribution  
- House 1: Norwegian, Yellow, ?, Dunhill, ?
- House 2: ?, Blue, ?, ?, Horse
- House 3: British, Red, Milk, ?, ?
- House 4: ?, Green, Coffee, ?, ?
- House 5: ?, White, ?, ?, ?

From constraint 3: Dutch person drinks tea
From constraint 12: Short Hope smoker drinks beer
From constraint 13: German smokes Marlboro
From constraint 2: Swedish person owns dog

### Step 5: Final Deductions
Using constraints 10 and 15 about Camel smoker being next to both cat owner and water drinker, and working through all remaining assignments:

The remaining nationalities (Dutch, German, Swedish) go to houses 2, 4, 5.
The remaining drinks are distributed based on who drinks what.
The remaining cigarettes and pets are assigned using the adjacency constraints.

## Final Solution

| House | Nationality | Color  | Drink  | Cigarette    | Pet   |
|-------|-------------|--------|--------|--------------|-------|
| 1     | Norwegian   | Yellow | Water  | Dunhill      | Cat   |
| 2     | Dutch       | Blue   | Tea    | Camel        | Horse |
| 3     | British     | Red    | Milk   | Seven Stars  | Bird  |
| 4     | German      | Green  | Coffee | Marlboro     | Fish  |
| 5     | Swedish     | White  | Beer   | Short Hope   | Dog   |

## Answer
**The German owns the fish.**

## Verification
All 15 constraints are satisfied in this solution:
1. ✓ British (house 3) lives in red house
2. ✓ Swedish (house 5) owns dog  
3. ✓ Dutch (house 2) drinks tea
4. ✓ Green house (4) is left of white house (5)
5. ✓ Green house owner (house 4) drinks coffee
6. ✓ Seven Stars smoker (house 3) owns bird
7. ✓ Yellow house owner (house 1) smokes Dunhill
8. ✓ Middle house owner (house 3) drinks milk
9. ✓ Norwegian lives in first house
10. ✓ Camel smoker (house 2) next to cat owner (house 1)
11. ✓ Horse owner (house 2) next to Dunhill smoker (house 1)
12. ✓ Short Hope smoker (house 5) drinks beer
13. ✓ German (house 4) smokes Marlboro
14. ✓ Norwegian (house 1) next to blue house (house 2)
15. ✓ Camel smoker (house 2) next to water drinker (house 1)
